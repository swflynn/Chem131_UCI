# Discussion Assignments
Welcome to the discussion section of the course. 
Here you will find the problems generated by the TAs each week.
These problems will be reviewed during discussion and solutions will be sent out.


Expect something like 3 problems a week.
One written by each TA, and then a computational problem.

## Webassign
The official (graded) homework for the course are the Webassign problems, assigned by Dr. Hemminger. 
These problems can be discussed during discussion if students have interest, however, solutions `Will Not` be sent out.
Please come discuss these problems with either TA or the instructor if you are stuck on any of the problmes. 

## Computational Resources
If you have access to a computer, then you can benefit from learning basic programming. 
Any person who interacts with data should learn to use basic computaional resources for storing, managing, plotting, and analyzing that data.
The majority of scientific problems cannot be solved analytically (with pen and paper), computational methods are essential for working on cutting-edge problems.

### Mathematica
Mathematica is a private mathmatical software, made available for free to students at UCI.

`https://uci.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0010917`

Chem 5 at UCI requires the use of Mathematica, so we have decided to also use Mathematica for the primary software during Chem132A. 
We will use this software to introduce students to basic computational skills, and solve more interesting problems numerically. 

#### Mathematica Tutorial
The `Mathematica_Tutorial` contains an example mathematica notebook written by `Alan Robledo` (Furche Group, UCI). 
This tutorial covers various useful commands available in Mathematica, and was made with Chem132A in mind. 

### Python
Python is an open-source (free) all-purpose programming language that is heavily used in the scientific community (data science and biolgical sciences for example). 
Python is one of the easiest programming languages to learn, and can be used for general programming (not just scientific computing). 
For this reason, we have decided to also prepare solutions using Python for this course.
