# Teaching Resources
Greetings!

Here I will make available various resources developed during my time as a graduate student at the University of California, Irvine. 
The resources will include my Lecture Notes (i.e. the notes I take during a given lecture), and comments/reviews of topics I think students may find useful to better understand the lecture material. 
You will also find some basic programming (mostly Python and Fortran) where I solve various problems taken from textbooks, lecture, and curiosity.  

I strive to make these materials as accurate as possible, however, I cannot guarantee they will be perfect (or up-to-date). 
Please use the materials with that in mind, and feel free to contact me if there are any potential mistakes I can correct. 

## Material Usage:
All materials made available here are the product of my interest and understanding of the topic. 
I am generting these materials as a scholarly pursuit, not for hire, and have decided to make them freely available. 
All Lecture Notes have been made with permission of the Lecturer, however, they contain my personal understanding and adaptation of the topics covered and not explicitly the thoughts/statements of the Lecturer. 

Any example problems or figures taken/adapted from textbooks and external sources will include reference to the location from which it came.
I do not claim any rights to these materials (the solutions/programs are my understanding of the topic and not the work of the original material author).

For these reasons I have decided to place the content under (c) Shane Flynn and contributers, with the following understanding:

<a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"><img alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0" src="https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png" /></a><br />This work is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a>.

Please feel free to share, copy and redistribute the material in any format, and to change and build upon the material. 
Under the terms of giving appropriate credit (reference the original work and changes made), adapted work must remain under ShareAlike, and you MAY NOT use the material for commercial purposes.

## Using Github:
If you are new to github, you can think of this as a dropbox, there are files that can be updated dynamically.
Each folder contains materials that you can look at online, and/or download to your local device.
Simply click the files on the left hand side (in blue) at the top of each page, do not use the middle section (gray). 

If you are familiar with Github, feel free to use the resources as you wish.
I am open to collaboration for developing new materials!

## Summary of Materials
Here I provide a brief overview of the contents within each directory. 

### Chem131_C_2017:
Lecture notes and problems for the undergraduate Thermodynamics Course taught at UCI. 

`Lecturer: Craig Martens` (cmartens@uci.edu)

Teaching Assistants: `Krista Parry` (parryk@uci.edu) and `Shane Flynn` (swflynn@uci.edu)

This course covers an undergraduate level (junior and senior) introduction to Thermodynamics (Chemistry Department). 
The course assumes knowledge of basic quantum chemistry and multi-variable calculus, but is essentially self-contained. 

Topics included are: the Laws of Thermodynamics, Thermodynamic Potentials and Fundamental Equations, Statistical Mechanics and it connections to Thermodynamics, and Quantum-Statistical Mechanics connecting partition functions to Quantum Chemistry and Thermodynamics. 
To keep the mathematics simple, we only consider the ideal gas law as our system model (van der Walls and virial equations are not covered). 

### Chem132_A_2017:
Lecture notes and problems for the undergraduate Physical Chemistry Thermodynamics Course taught at UCI. 

`Lecturer: John Hemminger` (jchemmin@uci.edu)

Teaching Assistants: `Moises Romero` (moiseser@uci.edu) and `Shane Flynn` (swflynn@uci.edu)

This course covers an undergraduate level (junior and senior) introduction to Thermodynamics (Chemistry Department). 
The course provides a standard introduction to thermodynamics without any knowledge of quantum mechanics. 
If you have not studied physical chemistry before, this couse should be your starting place. 

Topics included are: perfect gas, real gas, the Laws of Thermodynamics, mixtures and chemical equilibrium, molecular motion, chemical kinetics, and collision theory.
